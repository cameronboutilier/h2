You'll likely have to change the port on the api url in ./spa/src/api.js

You'll also want to change the connection string inside of ./api/api/appsettings.json accordingly

After you make those changes and create the database you should be able to run the api project and then the spa project. 

If you have any problems feel free to contact me.
